[**GUIDE**](instructions.md)

## Credit

I took inspiration from [this Youtube-Video](https://youtu.be/XBa89FEDJbg) and also used this [forum post](http://myosx.info/topic/43-imessage-on-vmware-os-x-yosemite-and-el-capitan/).
For generating the MLB and ROM values i seeked some information from [here](http://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/how-to-fix-imessage.110471/#post-962419) and [here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/303073-pattern-of-mlb-main-logic-board/).

To those whom i forgot, i'm sorry and please contact me!

## Update by Erich
This is a very comprehensive and easy guideline and it worked on my host windows 10 + VMWare Player 14, guest MacOS High Sierra installed following:

I also download Clover Configuraator (Vibrant Edition) at:

Vibrant edition is a liitle different with classic version. So I have also updated screenshots.
